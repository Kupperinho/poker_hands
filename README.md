# poker_hands
When I started to learn poker I thought it may be a good idea to learn both at the same time - poker and Python.
So I wrote this program that displayes every information needed to make the very first decicion in a poker game.
After these informations are shown program gathers data depend of what action user makes and put it in a file so it can be studied after.
